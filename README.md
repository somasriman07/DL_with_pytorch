# DL-Projects

A collection of deep learning and machine learning notebooks, organized by topic and framework. Includes PyTorch, TensorFlow, Optuna tuning, RNNs, and end-to-end ML pipelines.

## Projects

### 1. Fashion MNIST – PyTorch ANN
File: `fashion_mnist_pytorch_ANN.ipynb`  
A basic artificial neural network using PyTorch to classify Fashion MNIST images.

### 2. Fashion MNIST – TensorFlow (Advanced)
Files:
- `fashion_mnist_extended.ipynb`: Advanced model improvements using TensorFlow.
- `optuna_hyperparameter_mnist.ipynb`: Hyperparameter tuning with Optuna.
- `fashion_mnist_CNN_and_transferlearning.ipynb`: CNN and transfer learning implementations.
- `fmnist_small.csv`: Preprocessed dataset for experiments.

Folder: `fashion_mnist_advanced/`

### 3. RNN for Question Answering
File: `rnn_simple_question_answer.ipynb`  
A basic RNN model for simple question-answering tasks.

Folder: `rnn_question_answering/`

### 4. End-to-End Machine Learning – Placement Prediction
Files:
- `End_End_baisc_ml.ipynb`: A complete machine learning pipeline from data preprocessing to model deployment.
- `placement.csv`: Dataset used for training and testing.

Folder: `ml_placement_prediction/`
